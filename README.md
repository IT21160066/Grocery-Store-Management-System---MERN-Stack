#### Brief Description of Project -

This Project is about creating a Grocery stores management system. Due to the pandemic situation most of the community has moved to seek online based goods and services. As a result, this app will provide a convenient and hygienic shopping experience for both buyers and sellers. The farmers and the wholesalers who are unable to sell their goods due to the competition and low price rates in market can directly register to this system and take the advantage of wholesale their items for a reasonable value, small businesses and small store owners who do not have a proper customer base and an online platform, can register, and buy items through this system, as well as sell their products using our brand name. Customers who purchase items through this app can have them delivered from the nearest store to their homes and have discounts, promotions, and other benefits. Part-time job seekers can take advantage of applying for the position of drivers in our delivery service. This application manages customers, suppliers, orders, deliveries, and all grocery items. There are several administrators in the system to perform customer management, delivery management, financial management, stock management and system Management. Customers, Suppliers are the external parties who can access the system.
